A recorded sound will need to be edited and perhaps altered many times. ✓ ✓<br> − Scheduling multimedia projects is also difficult because the technology of computer hardware and software is in constant flux, and upgrades while your project is under way may drive you to new installations and concomitant learning curves. ✓ ✓<br>− In scheduling for a project that is to be rendered for a client, remember that the client will need to approve or sign off on your work at various stages. This approval process can wreak havoc with your schedule since it takes time and depends upon factors beyond your control. ✓ ✓",
